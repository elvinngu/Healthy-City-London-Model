# ArcGIS_NetworkAnalysis

There are two folders here. With the code in both folders, a network analysis can be done for each household in London. 

### LondonNetwork
The LondonNetwork folder contains code that can help develop a map of London as a polyline shape file that contains the roads, sidewalks, cycling path and etc. in London.

### Household Analysis
The HouseholdAnalysis folder contains code that can calculate the average ratings of services within a certain radius from a household. For example, the number of restaurants within 15 minutes walk from a household location can be calculated including the average ratings of all the restaurants within the radius.
