# ArcGIS_NetworkAnalysis

There are two folders here. With the code in both folders, a network analysis can be done for each household in London. 

### LondonNetwork
The LondonNetwork folder contain two set of codes that can produce a polyline shapefile from an OpenStreetMap (OSM) document

### Household Analysis
The HouseholdAnalysis folder contains code that can calculate the average ratings of services within a certain radius from a household. For example, the number of restaurants within 15 minutes walk from a household location can be calculated including the average ratings of all the restaurants within the radius.
